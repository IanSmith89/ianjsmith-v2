								<p className="approach-description">
									My path to UX design started at a young age
									with my early determination to one day be an
									architect. As I was sure I would never do
									anything else I first attended college to
									study architecture via an environmental
									design program. After realizing that I
									wasn't a fit for the profession I decided to
									switch majors to graphic design. This turned
									out to be an excellent choice for me.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									Since graduating with my B.F.A. in Graphic
									Design I have worked at screen printing and
									embroidery shops, photography studios,
									coding bootcamps, and most recently for
									consulting agencies. I'm fascinated by the
									variety of industries and people that design
									has exposed me to. The challenges of trying
									to understand how others think and feel are
									what gets me out of bed in the morning. I
									appreciate the lessons I've learned so far
									and look forward to the perpetual education
									that the future holds.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									In my free time, I like to go snowboarding,
									running, or hiking depending on the season.
									I grew up playing ice hockey in Colorado, so
									I'm a huge Avalanche fan. I'm also an
									unashamed Renaissance art admirer, but I do
									love a good mosh pit. And in case you were
									wondering I market myself with a "J."
									because it rolls off the tongue better than
									Ian Smith. Also, it's my middle initial.

									I like to apply design thinking to any
									problem I face. Whether it's user research,
									interaction design, prototyping, information
									architecture, or visual design, I'm not
									afraid to take a step back in my process. I
									know you{' '}
									<span className="strike">rarely</span> never
									get everything right the first time. It's
									simply human nature.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									I've learned to take an iterative approach
									to design and to view mistakes as positive
									learning opportunities. Focusing on process
									over results has shown me the power of
									having a growth mindset. If I'm not
									knowledgable about a problem I know it only
									takes time and a willingness to learn. I
									thrive at revisiting ideas or moving on to
									the next one when the time is right so that
									problems turn into solutions.
