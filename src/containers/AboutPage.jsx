								<p className="approach-description">
									My path to UX design started at a young age
									with my early determination to one day be an
									architect. I was sure I would never do
									anything else, so I first attended college
									to study architecture via an environmental
									design program. After realizing that I
									wasn't a fit for the profession I decided to
									switch majors to graphic design. This turned
									out to be an excellent choice for me.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									Since graduating in 2013 with a B.F.A. in
									Graphic Design I have worked at screen
									printing and embroidery shops, photography
									studios, coding boot camps, and most
									recently for consulting agencies. I love
									taking on the challenges of understanding
									how others think and feel. With this
									information, I also enjoy figuring out how
									to realize meaningful designs by leveraging
									my experience as a developer. This
									compliments my design sensibilities while
									allowing me to effectively communicate with
									anyone involved in the process. I appreciate
									the lessons I've learned so far, and I look
									forward to the perpetual education that the
									future holds.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									Depending on the season, I like to go
									snowboarding, running, or hiking in my free
									time. I grew up playing ice hockey in
									Colorado, so I'm a huge Avalanche fan. I'm
									also an unashamed Renaissance art admirer,
									but I do love a good mosh pit. And in case
									you were wondering I market myself with a
									"J." to add a little pizzazz to my somewhat
									generic name. Also, it's my middle initial.

									I like to apply design thinking to any
									problem I face. Whether it's user research,
									interaction design, prototyping, information
									architecture, or visual design, I'm not
									afraid to take a step back in my process. I
									know you{' '}
									<span className="strike">rarely</span> never
									get everything right the first time. It's
									simply human nature.
								</p>
								<p className="approach-description">
									I've learned to take an iterative approach
									to design and to view mistakes as positive
									learning opportunities. Focusing on process
									over results has shown me the power of
									having a growth mindset. Working through
									ambiguity is one of my strengths because I
									know it only takes time and a willingness to
									learn when it comes to an unfamiliar
									challenge. I thrive at revisiting ideas or
									moving on to the next one when the time is
									right so that problems end up turning into
									solutions.
